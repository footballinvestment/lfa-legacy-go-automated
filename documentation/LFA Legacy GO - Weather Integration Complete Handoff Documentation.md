### **Weather Rules Initialization**

- **Automatic**: Weather rules auto-initialize on first startup
- **Manual**: Can be re-initialized via admin endpoint if needed
- **Customizable**: Admin can modify weather rules per game type

### **Database Warnings (Non-Critical)**

```
SQLAlchemy relationship warnings for WeatherForecast.location and WeatherAlert.location
These are informational warnings and do not affect functionality
Can be resolved by adding overlaps="weather_forecasts" parameter if needed
```
